# SwiftUI Onboarding

This repository contains the code for the SwiftUI Onboarding project, which supports the article ["SwiftUI Onboarding Architecture"](https://medium.com/@telawittig/swiftui-onboarding-architecture-a3f5b86a6344) by Tela Wittig. The project demonstrates an architecture for implementing an onboarding flow in a SwiftUI application.

## Features

- **SwiftUI**: Utilizes SwiftUI for building user interfaces.
- **Onboarding Flow**: Implements a multi-step onboarding process.
- **State Management**: Uses state management techniques to handle the onboarding flow.
- **Reusable Components**: Includes reusable SwiftUI components for the onboarding screens.

## Requirements

- **Xcode 12.0 or later**
- **iOS 14.0 or later**

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/twittt/SwiftUI-Onboarding.git
    cd SwiftUI-Onboarding
    ```

2. **Open the project in Xcode**:

    ```bash
    open SwiftUI-Onboarding.xcodeproj
    ```

3. **Build and run the project**:

    Select your target device or simulator and press `Cmd+R` to build and run the project.

## Project Structure

- **SwiftUI-Onboarding.xcodeproj**: Xcode project file.
- **SwiftUI-Onboarding/ContentView.swift**: Main content view containing the onboarding flow.
- **SwiftUI-Onboarding/OnboardingStep.swift**: Swift file defining the onboarding steps and their content.
- **SwiftUI-Onboarding/OnboardingView.swift**: Swift file implementing the onboarding view.
- **SwiftUI-Onboarding/Resources/**: Assets and resources used in the project.

## Usage

1. **Customize Onboarding Steps**:

    To customize the onboarding steps, modify the `OnboardingStep` enum and the corresponding views in `OnboardingStep.swift`.

2. **Modify Onboarding Content**:

    Update the content of each onboarding step by modifying the views in `OnboardingView.swift`.

3. **State Management**:

    The state management for the onboarding flow is handled using SwiftUI's `@State` and `@Binding` properties. Customize the state management logic as needed in `ContentView.swift`.
